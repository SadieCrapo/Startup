# Greenhouse To-do List (working title)

[My Notes](notes.md)

A to-do list application with a greenhouse theme. As the user completes tasks, they earn seeds, pots, and plant food which can be used to grow plants in their greenhouse.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Traditional to-do lists are boring and often end up unfinished because they cannot hold our attention. My new product aims to prevent this by making it fun and engaging to check tasks off your to-do list. I do this by rewarding users with new plants to care for in their virtual greenhouses each time they complete a task!

### Design

![Homepage](./images/homepage.png)

This will be the homepage of the application. It will look like a greenhouse with shelves displaying all of the user's collected plants. There will be buttons that link to the user's to-do list (referred to as the field guide) and inventory (referred to as the backpack), as well as buttons to complete actions such as watering and feeding the plants, and planting new seeds.

![Field Guide](./images/field-guide.png)

This will be the user's to-do list. It will look like a field guide or journal and display the user's current tasks. Each task will have a checkbox to click when it has been completed. There will also be a greenhouse button to return to the homepage and a pencil button to add a new task.

![Backpack](./images/backpack.png)

This will be the user's inventory. It will display each of the user's collected seed and pot types, as well as their quantities. There will be a greenhouse button to return to the homepage.

![Login](./images/login.png)

This will be the authentification page for the application. Users will log in using their unique username and password, as well as a Greenhouse ID. The Greenhouse ID will allow them to collaborate on shared to-do lists as anyone with the ID will be able to join and contribute to that greenhouse.

### Key features

- Simple, easy-to-use task tracking
- Incentive to complete tasks
- Personal or shared to-do lists

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic structure for the four main webpages.
- **CSS** - Cohesive styling throughout the application, including colors and font. Manage spacing between elements on different display sizes.
- **React** - Provide transistions between pages, animations for feeding, watering, and planting, and represent new task creation.
- **Service** - Retrieve plants and previously saved tasks, store inventory, create to-do list with Todoist API.
- **DB/Login** - Register and log in users, store users and greenhouses in database, require credentials to access greenhouses. 
- **WebSocket** - In shared greenhouses, update plants and tasks in real time when other users complete tasks.
